Discreet math is the study if countable, distinct or separate mathematical structures.
In mathematics, set theory is the study of collections of objects, which is prerequisite
knowledge for studying discrete mathematics.

A set is a collection of objects. If a set A is made up of objects a 1 , a 2 , …, 
we write it as A = {a1 , a 2 , …}

Each object in a set A is called an element of A, and we write a n ∈ A. The empty set 
is denoted ∅.

A set A is a subset of B if all elements in A are also in B, and we write it as A ⊂ B. 
We call B a superset of A. If A is a subset of B, but they are not the same set, we call 
A a proper subset of B, and write A ⊆ B.

A set may be written as {x ∈ A | Conditions}, which consists of the subset of A such 
that the given conditions are true.

Basic set operations:

- Union
The union of sets A and B is the set of all elements in A or B (or both) and is
denoted A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}.

- Intersection
The intersection of sets A and B is the set of all elements in both A and B. It is
denoted A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}.

- Complement
The complement of set A is all elements in the set that are not in A and is denoted
Aᶜ = {x | x ∉ A}.

- Difference
The difference between sets A and B is the set of all elements in A, but not B,
denoted A - B = {x ∈ A | x ∉ B}.

Sets A and B are disjoint (or mutually exclusive) if A ∩ B = ∅ . In other words, the 
sets share no elements in common.

The cardinality, or size, of a set A is the number of elements in the set and is 
denoted |A|.
